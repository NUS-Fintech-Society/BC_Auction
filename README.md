# BlockchainAuction
Team 4 Auction dApp

## Project Idea
BlockchainAuction is a Web App for aunctioning Products using Blockchain coupled with ethereum accounts running on a ropsten server. Users can auction off anything on the chain that is available to them. The smart contract holds the auctioned asset and thereafter it manages bids associated in a seamless fashion.

The reason why Blockchain forms such a great platform is the promise of accuracy and guarantee of payment thanks to immutability of Blocks and allows for a more transparent, strict and fair auction experience.

More platforms like E-Bay are considering Blockchain as a next step to secure their transactions.
